Given that these are small individual housing rooms, to equate SRO projects with General Plan housing unit densities, the city shall apply a factor of two to the density range. That is, a General Plan density range of ten to twenty units per acre shall equate to an SRO project density range of twenty to forty rooms/acre. Density bonuses may also be applied to qualifying SRO projects.</text>

        <heading>Establishment of districts.</heading>
        <text>This chapter establishes two zoning districts to allow a broad range of commercial uses within those districts. The following commercial districts are hereby established:</text>
        <text>CC (community commercial) district: to accommodate a broad range of commercial uses that will serve local residents and the greater community and reduce the need for external trips to adjacent jurisdictions for goods and services, and provide shopping and service opportunities for commuters, visitors, and tourists. Also accommodates multifamily residential uses, especially in conjunction with a commercial use.</text>
        <text>CN (neighborhood commercial) district: to encourage a limited range of retail and service commercial uses that are oriented to the day-to-day needs of the local residents, at a scale compatible with adjacent neighborhoods. Also accommodates multifamily residential uses, especially in conjunction with a commercial use.</text>

        <heading>Permitted uses.</heading>
        <text>Table 1 of this section sets forth the permitted and conditionally permitted uses for each commercial district. A "P" designates a permitted use. A "C" indicates a conditionally permitted use subject to approval of a use permit by the planning commission. An "M" indicates a minor use permit is required pursuant to Chapter 19.42. If no letter is found opposite a particular use, it is not permitted in that district.</text>

        <heading>Development standards—Single-family subdivisions including those proposing lot sizes smaller than the baseline lot size.</heading>
        <text>The following standards shall be applicable to all single-family residential subdivisions within areas designated single-family or multifamily residential on the general plan land use map unless otherwise noted. The intent of these standards is to provide a measured degree of increased flexibility over standard single-family zoning while establishing compensating or circumstances that would justify greater variation than what would normally be expected. Minimum standards are established to ensure that the basic integrity of the single-family general plan designation is retained and that a range of lot sizes be provided to meet both current and future city housing needs for various home types and market ranges.</text>
        <para>
          <num>A.</num>
          <text>Baseline Lot Size/Mix of Lot Sizes. The baseline lot size shall be six thousand five hundred square feet. A reasonable proportion of lots proposed within a planned community may be less than the baseline with a minimum lot size of four thousand five hundred square feet. All lot sizes within a planned community may be larger than six thousand five hundred square feet although the reverse in which all lots are less than six thousand five hundred square feet is not permitted. The distribution and ratio of lot sizes shall be based on the following factors:</text>

Upon application prior to the expiration of the planned community development permit, the time at which the permit expires may be extended for a period or periods not exceeding a total of three years. Prior to the expiration of a planned community development permit, upon an application to extend the permit, the permit shall automatically be extended for sixty days or until the application for the extension is approved, conditionally approved or denied, whichever occurs first. If the application for extension is denied, the decision may be appealed to the city council within fifteen days after the planning commission has denied the extension. Should a planned community development permit expire, a rezoning of the property shall be initiated to an appropriate standard zoning district consistent with the applicable general plan designation.</text>

        <text>"Reference evapotranspiration" or "ETo" means a standard measurement of environmental parameters which affect the water use of plants. ETo is expressed in inches per day, month, or year as represented in <cite path="|19.22.060">Section 19.22.060</cite>, and is an estimate of the evapotranspiration of a large field of four- to seven-inch tall, cool-season grass that is well watered. Reference evapotranspiration is used as the basis of determining the maximum applied water allowance so that regional differences in climate can be accommodated.</text>
        <text>"Rehabilitated landscape" means any re-landscaping project that requires a permit, plan check, or design permit, meets the requirements of <cite path="|19.22.020">Section 19.22.020</cite>, and the modified landscape area is equal to or greater than two thousand five hundred square feet, is fifty percent of the total landscape area, and the modifications are completed within one year.</text>
        <text>"Runoff' means water which is not absorbed by the soil or landscape to which it is applied and flows from the landscape area. For example, runoff may result from water that is applied at too great a rate (application rate exceeds infiltration rate) or when there is a slope.</text>
        <text>"Special landscape area (SLA)" means an area of the landscape dedicated solely to edible plants, areas irrigated with recycled water, water features using recycled water and areas dedicated to active play such as parks, sports fields, golf courses, and where turf provides a playing surface.</text>

        <heading>Definition.</heading>
        <text>As used in this chapter, a "home occupation" is an accessory use of a dwelling for employment and/or business purposes that is incidental to and subordinate to the use of the dwelling unit as a residence, and that is so located and conducted that the average neighbor, under normal circumstances, would not be aware of its existence. Large family child care homes are exempt from this definition.</text>

        <heading>Findings.</heading>
        <para>
          <num>A.</num>
          <text>California's Unruh Civil Rights Act (Civil Code Section 51.1 et seq.) expressly allows private parties to establish housing for senior citizens and the Federal Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. Section 3601 et seq.) expressly allows for "housing for older persons."</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <num>B.</num>
          <text>State law encourages "senior citizen housing developments." Specifically, Government Code Section 65915 requires cities to provide "senior citizen housing developments" density bonuses for development of such facilities and provide lower parking standards. Therefore, by law, "senior only" housing facilities may receive concessions and incentives that non-senior facilities do not receive.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <num>C.</num>
          <text>On average, senior citizens make less impact on the environment than do non-seniors. Occupancy rates for seniors are significantly less than non-senior occupancy rates. Seniors make substantially fewer trips than non-seniors. Seniors drive fewer vehicles, and therefore require fewer parking spaces per housing unit than do non-seniors. This chapter acknowledges these facts when it applies a lower parking requirement for certain senior housing facilities than would have otherwise applied.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <num>D.</num>
          <text>Because, on average, senior citizens occupy few persons per dwelling unit than non-senior citizen residents, seniors use substantially less water per household than non-seniors. Therefore, if there is no discretionary process to administer changes from senior to non-senior mobilehome parks, the city's zero water footprint policy will not be applied to such land use changes. This will further jeopardize the city's ability to supply water to its residents in accordance with the fee structure adopted by the city council.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <num>E.</num>
          <text>Based on the foregoing, newly created or authorized non-senior facilities have a greater impact on the environment than do existing senior facilities. Therefore, the city determines that all conversions, as defined in this chapter, are "projects" within the meaning of Public Resources Code Section 21065.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <num>F.</num>
          <text>Government Code Section 65595 et seq., permit all of the following developments to pay lower developer fees to schools: developments which qualify as "senior citizen housing," "multilevel facility for the elderly" or as a "residential care facility for the elderly," and manufactured homes and mobilehomes in certain communities limited to older persons.</text>

          <text>Government Code Sections 65595.1 and 65595.2 demonstrate that cities should often disallow these senior housing uses from converting to</text>

        <text>non-senior housing uses until the full amount of school fees that would have otherwise been required to be paid were, in fact, paid.</text>
        <para>
          <num>H.</num>
          <text>If a previously approved facility obtained concessions or incentives because it indicated that it would qualify and operate as a senior housing project but subsequently lost its qualifying status, the development facility should mitigate the impacts on the community, including but not limited to offsetting the concessions and incentives previously received.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <num>I.</num>
          <text>If the city applied reduced public park dedications for senior restricted developments, or lowered fees for vehicular parking, transportation, and/or schooling because the project originally qualified as a senior housing project and then that project later converted to non-senior housing, the public would be harmed to the extent that the converted project did not provide the full amount of mitigation that would have been otherwise required. If a conversion occurs, the city should require that all impacts from the conversion are mitigated.</text>

        <text>Consistent with this chapter, the planning commission shall conduct a public hearing on all complete applications for conversion permits. The planning commission shall issue a conversion permit if it makes findings consistent with the following:</text>
        <para>
          <num>A.</num>
          <text>The proposed use of the property as something other than a senior housing project is in accord with the objectives of this chapter and the purposes of the zone in which the project site is located.</text>

          <num>C.</num>
          <text>The project will comply with all parking requirements of Municipal Code Chapter 19.21 which apply to non-senior facilities. If the city, however, in its sole and reasonable discretion determines that requiring parking spaces pursuant to this subsection would be detrimental to the public welfare, the applicant shall instead provide reasonable alternative parking accommodations. As part of the city's determination of whether the public welfare would be harmed, the city shall consider the ability of the applicant to provide additional parking without unreasonably degrading the appearance of the real property surrounding the structure.</text>

          <text>The applicant has paid or is required to pay as a condition of granting the conversion permit all required fees, including those required by Government Code Sections 65995 et seq., and Education Code Section 17620 relating to developer fees paid to school districts, and the city has received any authorization required to have been filed by the Napa Valley Unified School District pursuant to Government Code Section 65595.1, or any other section.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <num>E.</num>
          <text>All required notices were given, including those required by Government Code Section 65995.2 relating to school impact fees for mobilehome conversions, and Civil Code Section 798.25 relating to six-month notice of changes of regulations of mobilehome parks.</text>
        </para>

          <num>F.</num>
          <text>The applicant has complied with all actions required by the California Environmental Quality Act (Public Resources Code Section 21000 et seq.) including any duty to assess impact on the environment and resulting mitigation. These mitigation measures will address identified impacts to traffic, public transportation, noise, parking space, and vehicle parking and such other impacts as are identified by appropriate environmental review.</text>

        <text>Variances may be granted in order to prevent or to lessen practical difficulties and unnecessary physical hardships that would result from strict or literal interpretation and enforcement of certain regulations of this title. A practical difficulty or unnecessary physical hardship may result from the unique size, shape, or dimensions of a site or the location of existing structures thereon; from singular geographic, topographic, or other physical conditions on the site or in the immediate vicinity; or from population densities, street locations, or traffic conditions in the immediate vicinity. Cost to the applicant of strict or literal compliance with a regulation shall not be the sole reason for granting a variance.</text>

        <heading>Definitions.</heading>
        <text>For the purposes of this chapter, the following terms are defined as follows:</text>
        <text>"Appraised valuation" means either the appraised valuation for property tax purposes, updated as necessary by the increase in the consumer price index since the date of the last valuation, or the valuation determined by a professionally-recognized property appraiser.</text>
        <text>"Cost" of renovation or repair or replacement means the fair market value of the materials and services necessary to accomplish such renovation, repair, or replacement. Renovation, repair, or replacement costs shall be determined by the building official, whose decision may be appealed to the city council. The "cost" of such renovation of repair or replacement shall mean the total cost of all such intended work, and no person may seek to avoid the intent of this chapter by doing such work incrementally.</text>
        <text>"Nonconforming lots" means a lot, the area dimensions, or location of which was lawful prior to the effective date of this title, or any amendment thereto, but which fails by reason of such adoption, revision, or amendment to conform to the present requirements of the zoning district in which it is located.</text>
        <text>"Nonconforming structure" means any structure that was lawfully established and in compliance with the applicable ordinances and laws at the time the ordinance codified in this title or any amendment thereto became effective, but which, due to the application of this title or any amendment thereto, no longer complies with all the applicable regulations and standards of development in the zoning district in which it is located.</text>
        <text>"Nonconforming use" means any use of land or property that was lawfully established and in compliance with all applicable ordinances and laws at the time the ordinance codified in this title, or any amendment thereto, became effective, but which, due to the application of this title or any amendment thereto is a use not listed as permitted, accessory, or subject to permit in the zoning district in which it is located. "Nonconforming use" shall also include uses reclassified from permitted to subject to permit in the same district, and uses made nonconforming by the addition of a development standard previously not required for such use in the same zoning classification, where such added standard is specified to be a "condition of use."</text>

        <para>
          <num>A.</num>
          <text>A nonconforming structure shall not be moved, altered, enlarged, or reconstructed so as to increase the discrepancy between existing conditions and the development standards specified for the zoning district in which the structure is located, except that where a dwelling unit has a nonconforming side yard or rear yard setback, the nonconformity may be extended along the length of the nonconforming façade.</text>

          <num>C.</num>
          <text>Repairs and changes to interior partitions or other nonstructural improvements may be made to a nonconforming structure; however, the cost of such repairs and changes shall not exceed fifty percent of the appraised value of the structure to be renovated.</text>

          <num>D.</num>
          <text>Subject to the valuation limit in subsection (C) of this section, structural elements may be modified where the building official determines such modification is immediately necessary to protect the health and safety of the public or occupants of the nonconforming building or adjacent property.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <num>E.</num>
          <text>If the use of a nonconforming structure is discontinued for a period of twelve months or more, the structure shall lose its nonconforming status and shall thereafter be removed or altered to conform to the provisions of this title. For purposes of determining whether a right to continue a nonconforming situation is lost pursuant to this subsection, all of the buildings, activities, and operations maintained on a lot are generally to be considered as a whole. For example, the failure to rent one apartment in a nonconforming apartment building for twelve months shall not result in a loss of the right to rent that apartment or space thereafter so long as the apartment building as a whole is continually maintained.</text>
