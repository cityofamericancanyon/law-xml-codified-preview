    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution, and that breathing secondhand smoke is a cause of disease, including lung cancer, in nonsmokers. At special risk are elderly people, individuals with cardiovascular disease, and individuals with impaired respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructive airway disease); and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>health hazards induced by breathing secondhand smoke include lung cancer, heart disease, respiratory infection, decreased respiratory function, broncho-constriction, and broncho-spasm; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>more than 440,000 people die in the United States from tobacco-related diseases every year, making it the nation's leading cause of preventable death; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>the United States Environmental Protection Agency has found secondhand smoke to be a risk to public health and has classified secondhand smoke as a Group "A" carcinogen, the most dangerous class of carcinogen; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>the U.S. Surgeon General has concluded that there is no risk-free level of exposure to secondhand smoke; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>just 30 minutes of exposure to secondhand smoke is sufficient to damage blood vessels in a healthy nonsmoker; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>the California Air Resources Board has put secondhand smoke in the same category as the most toxic automotive and industrial air pollutants by categorizing it as a toxic air contaminant for which there is no safe level of exposure; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>secondhand smoke exposure adversely affects fetal growth with elevated risk of low birth weight and increased risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome in infants of mothers who smoke; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>in the United States, secondhand smoke is thought to cause about 46,000 heart disease deaths each year; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>secondhand smoke can seep under doorways and through wall cracks; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>the only way to fully protect nonsmokers from secondhand smoke is to completely eliminate smoking in indoor spaces. Separating smokers from nonsmokers, cleaning the air, and ventilating buildings cannot completely eliminate exposure to secondhand smoke; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>cigarette butts pose a health threat to children. Small children who had ingested cigarette butts exhibited symptoms of illness such as spontaneous vomiting, nausea, lethargy, and gagging; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>cigarette butts are a major and persistent source of litter. In the last 25 years of coastal clean-ups, cigarette and cigarette filters ranked as the number one source of waste comprising nearly 32% of all collected litter items; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>electronic smoking devices and other unapproved nicotine delivery products have a high appeal to youth due to their high tech design and availability in child-friendly flavors like cotton candy, bubble gum, chocolate chip cookie dough and cookies and cream milkshake; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>a CDC study showed that in 2011 4.7% of all high school students had tried e-cigarettes and that in 2012 that percentage more than doubled to 10.0% of all high school students; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>nonsmokers who live in multiunit dwellings can be exposed to neighbors' secondhand smoke, as evidenced by the following:</text>
    </recital>
    <text>
      <ul proof="needed">
        <li>Residents of multiunit housing have higher levels of cotinine (a biomarker for nicotine) in their blood and saliva than those living in detached houses;</li>
        <li>Among children who live in homes in which no one smokes indoors, those who live in multiunit housing have 45% higher cotinine levels than children who live in detached houses;</li>
        <li>Twelve studies have found between 26% and 64% of residents of multiunit housing report secondhand smoke drifting into their home;i</li>
        <li>Surveys have found that 65% to 90% of multiunit housing residents who experience secondhand smoke in their home are bothered by it,36 and a 2019-2020 survey documented variations in secondhand smoke source among multiunit housing residents in Los Angeles County, who reported secondhand smoke exposure from tobacco (39%), marijuana (36%), and e-cigarettes (9%);</li>
        <li>Between 44.0% and 46.2% of Californians living in multiunit housing with personal smoke- free home policies are exposed to secondhand smoke in their home; and</li>
      </ul>
    </text>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>harmful residues from tobacco smoke can be absorbed by and cling to virtually all indoor surfaces long after smoking has stopped and then be emitted back into the air, making this "thirdhand smoke" a potential health hazard, as evidenced by the following:</text>
    </recital>
    <text>
      <ul proof="needed">
        <li>Thirdhand smoke contains carcinogenic materials that accumulate over time, presenting a health hazard long after the initial smoke is gone;</li>
        <li>Studies consistently find that thirdhand smoke remains months after nonsmokers have moved into units where smokers previously lived, and a recent study documents that it can remain in units for years;</li>
        <li>Human exposure to these thirdhand smoke carcinogens can occur through inhalation, ingestion, or skin absorption through contact with carpeting, furnishings, or clothing;</li>
        <li>Thirdhand smoke potentially poses the greatest danger to infants and toddlers, who crawl on rugs and furnishings and place household items in their mouths;viii</li>
        <li>Nonsmoking people who are exposed to thirdhand smoke have significantly higher nicotine and cotinine levels than those who have not been exposed to thirdhand smoke;vi</li>
        <li>Research has shown that thirdhand smoke damages human cellular DNA45,and is carcinogenic at exposure levels relevant to residents of multiunit housing; and</li>
      </ul>
    </text>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>secondhand smoke in multiunit housing is a significant threat to the health and safety of California children, as evidenced by the following:</text>
    </recital>
    <text>
      <ul proof="needed">
        <li>About a quarter of those who live in multiunit housing (25.2%) are under the age of 18;iv</li>
        <li>The home is the primary source of secondhand smoke exposure for children;</li>
        <li>A national survey found that 56.4% of U.S. youth living in apartment units in which no one smokes have elevated blood cotinine levels above 0.05 ng/mL, indicating they have been exposed to potentially dangerous levels of secondhand smoke;ii</li>
        <li>The same survey also found that children who live in homes in which no one smokes indoors have 45% higher cotinine levels if they live in apartments compared with detached homes;ii and</li>
      </ul>
    </text>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>research demonstrates that a majority of adults supports smoke-free policies in multiunit residences, as evidenced by the following:</text>
    </recital>
    <text>
      <ul proof="needed">
        <li>73.7% of U.S. adults surveyed favor smoke-free public housing;</li>
        <li>63.5% of Californians surveyed favor restricting smoking inside apartment units; and</li>
      </ul>
    </text>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>there are significant savings from adopting a smoke-free multiunit housing policy, as evidenced by the following:</text>
    </recital>
    <text>
      <ul proof="needed">
        <li>Prior to implementation, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's smoke- free public housing policy was conservatively estimated to produce an annual savings of 4 to 8 million dollars a year for U.S. public housing authorities in renovation-related costs, and 30 to 109 million dollars per year in health care costs in California alone;</li>
        <li>Implementing statewide smoke-free policies in multiunit housing property would save property owners in California an estimated $18.1 million in renovation expenses each year;  and</li>
      </ul>
    </text>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>smoke-free multiunit hosing policies have been shown to have a meaningful impact on public health, as evidence by the following:</text>
    </recital>
    <text>
      <ul proof="needed">
        <li>An estimated 268% of Californians (or 10.17.3 million people) live in multiunit housing;</li>
        <li>The U.S. Surgeon General has concluded that eliminating smoking in indoor spaces is the only way to fully protect nonsmokers from secondhand smoke exposure; and that separating smokers from nonsmokers, cleaning the air, and ventilating buildings cannot completely prevent secondhand smoke exposure;</li>
        <li>Smoke-free housing policies resulted in a 24% reduction in self-reported exposure to secondhand smoke exposure among racially and ethnically diverse seniors living in low- income multiunit housing properties; and</li>
      </ul>
    </text>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>a duly-noticed public hearing was held by the City of American Canyon City Council on May 2, 2023 on the subject ordinance, at which time all those in attendance were given the opportunity to speak on this proposal and to submit comments.</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>NOW, THEREFORE</conjunction>
      <text>THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF AMERICAN CANYON DOES HEREBY ORDAIN AS FOLLOWS:</text>
    </recital>
  </recitals>
  <section>
    <num>1</num>
    <text>That smoking in all its forms in multiunit living environments is a nuisance.</text>
  </section>
  <section>
    <num>2</num>
    <text>The purpose of this ordinance is to: (1) protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in any unit of a multi-unit residence and any common area of a multi-unit residence because there is no risk-free level of exposure to secondhand smoke, and (2) guarantee the right of nonsmokers to breathe smoke-free air at their place of residence.</text>
