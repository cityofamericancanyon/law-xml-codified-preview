    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>the American Canyon Fire Protection District (District) provides fire protection, emergency medical services and hazardous material response to residents and businesses within the City of American Canyon (City);</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>the California Mitigation Fee Act authorizes the City to impose fees that offset the costs imposed on public services by new development, including the costs incurred for emergency response and fire protection services;</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>the District has identified the need to plan for the impact of future development on existing resources, including keeping pace with new development by constructing and equipping current and future fire stations, and therefore retained the services of AP Triton to conduct a Long- Range Master Plan and Capitol PFG to conduct a development impact fee study;</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>Capitol PFG has completed a development impact fee study which meets the requirements of the California Mitigation Fee Act. Specifically, the fee study makes findings as to the purpose and use of the fee as it pertains to the District's growth plan and the associated capital costs, and determines that the fees are supported by an appropriate "nexus" â€“ meaning the amount of the fees successfully approximate the actual costs for which they are intended to offset;</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>although the Fire Protection District Law of 1987 does not allow a fire district to directly charge a fee for public improvements, facilities, or equipment, it is common practice for fire districts to work with cities and counties to impose an impact fee on the fire district's behalf;</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>the mutual interest of the City and District are fulfilled by the City enacting a Development Impact Fee, as authorized by the Mitigation Fee Act and the City's police powers, to fund fire and emergency response services for the protection of lives and property of City residents and to ensure that the District has the resources and capabilities of keeping pace with new construction within the City;</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>consistent with Government Code section 66001, the City intends to levy a Development Impact Fee on all new residential, commercial, and industrial development within the City's boundaries, to fund capital equipment and facilities construction needs for the District;</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>at the Fire Board's January 24, 2023 Regular Meeting, the Board adopted a Resolution to begin the process of implementing a fee to offset the rising costs that new development imposes on the District, and to work with the City to implement the fee (for properties within both the City and the District) and to work with the County of Napa (for properties within the District and the County); and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>the proposed fee shall be updated on an annual basis to account for inflationary costs and/or as updates are needed based upon the current costs of construction and equipping fire stations.</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>NOW, THEREFORE</conjunction>
