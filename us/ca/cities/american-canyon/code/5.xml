      <heading>Intent and purpose.</heading>
      <text>The intent of this chapter is to provide a regulatory framework for permitting special events and temporary outdoor promotions. The use of private property, city streets or other city-owned or controlled property by large groups causes wear and tear on turf, park equipment and facilities, and requires city staff time to provide support services, such as traffic control. Such uses can also subject neighboring residents and businesses to noise and traffic. The purpose of this chapter is to ensure that special events and temporary outdoor promotions are conducted so as not to violate any other ordinance or regulation of the city, or cause detrimental effects to surrounding properties and the community-at-large. It is the intent of the city to protect the rights of the people to engage in expressive activities in the city's public places, as well as to regulate the time, place and manner of these activities in a reasonable and minimally restrictive fashion.</text>

A franchise granted pursuant to this chapter shall require liquidated damages, in an amount to be specified in the franchise, for specified breaches of the franchise including but not limited to, failure to commence construction, failure to meet construction plan benchmarks, failure to comply with rebuild plan benchmarks, failure to commence service, and material breach of franchise obligation(s). The franchise shall also provide that the city may withdraw liquidated damages owed from the grantee's security deposit, after complying with the procedures set forth in subsection (A) of this section. Liquidated damages shall commence on that date that performance was due and/or failed, and continue until the grantee demonstrates to the satisfaction of the city that the grantee has fully performed its obligations giving rise to the payment of liquidated damages. Any obligation to pay liquidated damages does not in any way affect the grantee's obligation to pay franchise fees or perform other franchise obligations and such liquidated damages do not constitute franchise fees and are not subject to any limitations on franchise fees contained in 47 U.S.C. ยง 542(b). Any obligation to pay liquidated damages are not costs of satisfying franchise requirements as provided in 47 C.F.R. ยง 76.925.

The proposed transferee shall pay all reasonable costs incurred by the city in reviewing and evaluating the applications. The city may consider a resolution either approving or denying a transfer application within a reasonable period of time, or within the timeframes provided by federal law, whichever is longer.

        <heading>Franchise fee.</heading>
        <text>A cable communications system operator shall pay to the city a franchise fee in an amount equal to five percent of gross revenues, or such other amount as may be specified in the franchise; provided, however, that if the franchise specifies an amount, that amount shall be subject to increase should federal limits on fee payments be eliminated or changed and other operators are subject to a higher fee.</text>

          <text>Bundled Services. In the event that the franchisee shall, during the term of the franchise, offer bundled, tied, or combined cable services (which are subject to the franchise fee) with noncable services (which may not be subject to the franchise fee) to individual subscribers, the combined revenues from such bundled services shall be allocated consistent with the rates or prices advertised by the franchisee through its marketing materials or on its published rate card. In the event the franchisee does not advertise or publish separate prices for the combined services, the percentage that the price for the combined services is discounted from the regular retail rates of the individual services shall be prorated across all the services in the bundled package; provided, however, that the net revenues derived from services subject to mandatory tariff rates imposed by the California Public Utilities Commission (or other governmental entity having such authority) shall be deducted from the combined revenue to determine the revenue subject to the franchise fee. As an example, franchisee may offer a "bundle" of video, voice and data services for a flat fee of seventy-five dollars where the retail rate for the services purchased on an individual basis would equal one hundred dollars. Assuming that there is no service subject to the mandated tariff rate, grantee would apply a twenty-five percent discount to each service. Thus, if the retail rate for the cable service in the bundle were fifty dollars, grantee would recognize cable service revenue in the amount of thirty-seven dollars and fifty cents and pay a franchise fee on that revenue.</text>

If a change in federal law occurs subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, such change shall not impact the gross revenues definition in such a way to reduce gross revenues unless the change specifically preempts the affected portion of the definition in subsection (B) of this section.</text>

    <section>
      <num>5.70.010</num>
      <heading>Purpose.</heading>
      <text>This chapter aims to protect and promote the public health, safety, and welfare during the novel coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) emergency by requiring grocery stores to provide hazard pay for grocery workers performing work in the city of American Canyon. Some grocery stores have voluntarily provided additional compensation, but others have not. Requiring competing grocery stores to provide hazard pay will ensure that grocery workers are compensated for the risks of working during a pandemic. Grocery workers face increased risk of catching or spreading COVID-19 because the nature of their work involves close contact with the public and co-workers, including individuals who are not showing symptoms of COVID-19 but who can spread the disease. Hazard pay also ensures the retention of these essential grocery store workers who are on the frontlines of this pandemic providing essential services and who are needed throughout the duration of the COVID-19 emergency.</text>

      <text>The following terms shall have the following meanings:</text>
      <text>"Adverse action" means reducing the compensation to a grocery worker, garnishing gratuities, temporarily or permanently denying or limiting access to work, incentives, or bonuses, offering less desirable work, demoting, terminating, deactivating, putting a grocery worker on hold status, failing to rehire after a seasonal interruption of work, threatening, penalizing, retaliating, or otherwise discriminating against a covered employee. "Adverse action" also encompasses any action by the covered employer or a person acting on the covered employer's behalf that would dissuade a covered employee from exercising any right afforded by this chapter.</text>
      <text>"Baseline compensation" means the hourly compensation paid to covered employees as of the effective date of this chapter after subtracting any premium compensation used to compensate covered employees for working during the pandemic. Baseline compensation does not include hazard pay owed under this chapter, but does include premium compensation unrelated to the pandemic, such as holiday premiums paid for performing work during a holiday.</text>

      <text>"Covered employee" means a grocery worker who is entitled to hazard pay pursuant to this chapter.</text>

          <num>3.</num>
          <text>The covered employer bears the burden of proof that the additional compensation is hazard pay and not baseline compensation. No covered employer shall be credited prospectively for any past payments. No covered employer shall be credited for any hourly premiums already owed to covered employees, such as, but not limited to, holiday premiums, however there shall be a rebuttable presumption that compensation paid by a covered employer at a particular grocery store in January 2020 was baseline compensation for purposes of calculating hazard pay at that particular grocery store. Nothing herein shall be interpreted to prohibit any employer from paying more than five dollars per hour in hazard pay.</text>
