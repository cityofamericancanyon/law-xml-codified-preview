    <text>CEQA FINDINGS. The City Council finds the municipal code amendment is not subject to the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") pursuant to Section 15060(c)(2) because the activity will not result in a direct or reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment; and Section 15060(c)(3) because the activity is not a project as defined in Section 15378 of the CEQA Guidelines, California Code of Regulations, Title 14, Chapter 3 because it has no potential for resulting in physical change to the environment, directly or indirectly.  In addition, the municipal code amendment is not a project under CEQA Regulation Section 15061(b)(3) because it has no potential for causing a significant effect on the environment.</text>
