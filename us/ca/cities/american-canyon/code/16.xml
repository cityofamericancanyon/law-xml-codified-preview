      <heading>Findings and determination.</heading>
      <text>As permitted in <cite doc="Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code" path="§17958.7">Health and Safety Code Section 17958.7</cite>, the city of American Canyon finds and determines the local amendments to the 2022 California Building Code are either administrative in nature or reasonably necessary to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the public due to local climatic, geological or topographical conditions. Those findings are as follows:</text>
      <text>Express Finding Number 1: Climatic. The city is located in a climatic zone with precipitation ranging from fifteen to twenty-six inches per year. Ninety-five percent of precipitation falls during the months of November through April, leaving a dry period of approximately six months each year. Relative humidity remains moderate most of the time. High temperatures in the summer average in the mid-eighty degrees Fahrenheit and in the winter in the mid-fifty degrees Fahrenheit. Prevailing winds in the area are common with gusts up to thirty-five miles per hour. These climatic conditions, along with our topography, necessitate a greater requirement for fire-sprinklers in residential construction, a minimum Class A roof covering and adequate spark arrestors.</text>
      <text>Express Finding Number 2: Geological. The city is located in Seismic Design Category D, which is indicative of high seismic vulnerability. The West Napa fault is documented to be present in our city. The area includes various soil conditions and areas with significant movement potential. Buildings and other structures in Seismic Design Category D can experience major seismic damage. These geological conditions necessitate the prohibition of gypsum as a lateral-resisting building element, and the restriction of Portland cement plaster as a lateral-resisting building element to one-story structures of R-3 and U-1 occupancies.</text>
      <text>Express Finding Number 3: Topographical. Areas of highly combustible dry grasses, weeds, brush and trees adjacent to structures are common throughout the city. Above-ground electrical power transmission lines are suspended through trees and above large areas of dry vegetation. The arrangement of man-made features around many buildings greatly limits any approach to all but one side of a building. The area immediately adjacent to the eastern border of the city has been classified as high and very high fire severity zones under the Fire and Resource Assessment Program of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. These topographical conditions, along with our climate, necessitate a greater requirement for fire-sprinklers in residential construction, a minimum Class A roof covering and adequate spark arrestors.</text>

      <heading>Amend Section 105.5 Expiration.</heading>
      <text>Section 105.5 is hereby deleted and amended to read as follows:</text>
      <text>Every permit issued by the Building Official under the provisions of this code shall expire by limitation and become null and void if the building, structure, equipment or work authorized by such permit is not commenced within twelve (12) months from the date of such permit, or if the building, structure, equipment or work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned at any time after the work is commenced for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days.</text>
      <text>Before such work can recommence, a new permit shall be first obtained to do so, and the recommence fee shall be one half the amount required for a new permit (i.e. building, electrical, plumbing and mechanical fees only) for such work, provided no changes have been made or will be made in the original plans and specifications for such work, and provided further such suspension or abandonment has not exceeded one year. To renew a permit after expiration for over one year, the permittee shall pay new full permit fee. The maximum life of any permit is three (3) years.</text>
      <text>Any permittee holding an unexpired permit may apply for an extension of the time within which work may commence under that permit when the permittee is unable to commence work within the time frame required by <cite path="|16.02.080">this section</cite> for good and satisfactory reasons. The Building Official may extend the time for action by the permittee for a period not exceeding one hundred eighty (180) days on written request by the permittee showing circumstances beyond the control of the permittee that prevented action from being taken.</text>

      <heading>Amend Section 205 Board of appeals.</heading>
      <text>Section 205 is deleted and replaced as follows:</text>
      <text><strong>205.1 General.</strong> In order to hear and decide appeals of orders, decisions or determinations made by the building official relative to the application and interpretation of this code, there shall be and is hereby created a board of appeals. The board of appeals shall be appointed by the City Council and shall hold office at its pleasure. The board shall adopt rules of procedure for conducting its business.</text>
      <text>Alternatively, the City may use five (5) Building Official members of the Napa-Solano Chapter of the International Code Council (NSICC), chosen on a case-by-case basis, to serve as the Board of Appeals for the City of American Canyon. The NSICC, an organization of Building Officials, Building Inspectors, and Construction Industry personnel, was formed in 1978 to help maintain consistent and uniform code enforcement and code interpretation within the jurisdictions of Napa and Solano counties. Building Officials from jurisdictions within Napa and Solano counties and neighboring counties are members of the NSICC.</text>
      <text>Building Official members of the NSICC are well versed in the technical and administrative provisions of construction codes.</text>
      <text><strong>205.2 Limitations of Authority.</strong> The board shall have no authority relative to interpretation of the administrative provisions of this code nor shall the board be empowered to waive requirements of this code. An application for appeal shall be based on a claim that the true intent of this code or the rules legally adopted thereunder have been incorrectly interpreted, the provisions of this code do not fully apply or an equally good or better form of construction is proposed. Appeals from any findings by the Board of Appeals may be made by the applicant, a member of the City Council or the Building Official upon request in writing to the City Council within ten (10) days from the date of the Board's action.</text>
      <text><strong>205.3 Qualifications.</strong> The board of appeals shall consist of members who are qualified by experience and training to pass on matters pertaining to building construction and are not employees of the jurisdiction.</text>

      <text><strong>3403.6.2.2.1 Evaluation.</strong> The building shall be evaluated by a registered design professional, and the evaluation findings shall be submitted to the code official. The evaluation shall establish whether the damaged building, if repaired to its pre-damage state, would comply with the provisions of the building code.
