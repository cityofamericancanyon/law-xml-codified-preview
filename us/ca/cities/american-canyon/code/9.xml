      <text>The property owner, or person having charge or control of the property, may at their own expense abate the nuisance as prescribed by the notice to abate or the order of the city council, if any, prior to the expiration of the abatement period set forth in the notice or the order. If and when an owner or occupant undertakes to abate any such nuisance, the community development director or designated representative may impose such conditions as are necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare. Any necessary permits and/or approvals shall be obtained by the owner or occupant. After the property has been inspected by the community development director or designated representative, and the nuisance has been fully abated in accordance with the notice to abate or order, the proceedings shall terminate. The city manager or the community development director or designated representative may extend the abatement period specified in the notice to abate or any order to abate upon a showing of good cause.</text>
