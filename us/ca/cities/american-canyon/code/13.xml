      <text>"Large industrial" means any premises whose annual water use is in excess of four thousand two hundred units (Ccf) per year, is located within city boundaries, is separately connected to the water system, and whose predominant water use is for industrial purposes.

        <text>The city may impose the conditions listed below on new water services for outside customers and other outside customers by including these conditions in the "will-serve" letters that the city provides to such customers, but only if the city also imposes the same conditions on all new water services for parcels with similar uses within the city's limits.

          <text>City Capacity Fees and Conditions of Approval for Water Service. Capacity fees charged for parcels within the city's water service area shall be established by the city and will be periodically reviewed and updated. Capacity fees (also known as connection fees) will be uniform throughout the water service area, regardless of whether the parcel to which the fee applies is inside or outside the city's limits. The capacity fee and any conditions on new water service will be determined based on the Water Supply Report, which shall contain the analysis described in the City-County Agreement Part II.C. of Exhibit F, and which will be consistent with the city's Zero Water Footprint Policy, adopted by the city on October 23, 2007, or as may be subsequently amended.</text>

          <text>Cost of Water Service. The cost of new water service shall be imposed through the capacity fees in the city's Ordinance 2007-09 or through new capacity fees approved by Napa County and enacted in a new city ordinance. However, if the Water Supply Report finds, consistent with the city's Zero Water Footprint Policy or as may be subsequently amended (see City-County Agreement Exhibit F), that the city will have to obtain additional water supplies to meet "dry year" shortfalls, then the cost of water to meet such "dry year" shortfalls will be the sole responsibility of the applicant. In determining whether or not such "dry year" shortfalls will occur, the city shall include in the base supplies available to the city during "dry years" the new water supplies that have been or will be included in the calculations used to set the city's capacity fees and water rates. The city will conclude that "dry year" shortfalls will occur only if such base supplies will not be adequate to meet anticipated "dry year" demands. The city may not impose any costs on the applicant under <cite path="|13.10.010">this section</cite> to reimburse the city for any capital or operating costs that have been or will be included in the calculations used to set the city's capacity fees or water rates. The city may impose the additional costs described in the preceding sentence on outside customers and other outside customers only if the city also imposes such additional costs uniformly on city customers.</text>

These options include, but are not limited to, retrofitting of existing residences with low flow fixtures, purchase of otherwise developable land as permanent open space, or acquisition of other water supply resources as provided for by a water supply analysis that follows the Zero Water Footprint Methodology, or as may be subsequently amended, described in Exhibit F to the City-County Agreement. The city shall make all such options available uniformly to applicant for city water service for parcels within the Airport Industrial Area Specific Plan area and for parcels with similar uses within the city's limits and other outside customers with parcels with similar uses, and that seek such offsets.</text>

      <heading>Water conservation stages.</heading>
      <text>The intent of <cite path="|13.14.070">this section</cite> is to provide for the escalation of customer demand management strategies that may be necessary due to an emergency caused by drought and/or water supply shortages. There are six stages of strategies, each of which builds upon its predecessor stage and are to be implemented as the severity of conditions increase. Stage 6 can be implemented at any time due to catastrophic events and conditions, either natural or unnatural, including flooding, major fire emergencies, earthquakes, regional power outages, water contamination, and emergencies other than water shortage. No customer of the city shall make, cause, use, or permit the use of water from the city for residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, governmental, or any other purpose in a manner contrary to any provision of <cite path="13.14">this chapter</cite>, or in an amount in excess of what is permitted in accordance with the provisions of <cite path="13.14">this chapter</cite>. The reductions shall be based upon the amount of water used during that base period defined as the amount of water used on a customer's property during the corresponding monthly billing period in the previous year, or other year as may be designated by the city council. New services or services without a base year billing history shall be allotted on comparable customer usage.</text>

        <text>Stage 1—Voluntary Conservation. The intent of Stage 1 is to achieve an overall system-wide demand reduction of ten percent. The city council may, by resolution, declare a "Drought Emergency Stage 1 (Voluntary Conservation)" upon recommendation by the manager and based on water supply and delivery projections by the maintenance and utilities director, that an overall system-wide reduction of ten percent is necessary. During Stage 1, all water customers of the city shall be requested to implement the following best practices:</text>

      <text>Water use beyond the maximum allowed for each water conservation stage shall be subject to a drought surcharge pursuant to the schedule set forth below.

Application forms and instructions will be available at the American Canyon City Hall.</text>
      <text>In addition to the general water service rates, each customer shall pay, during each billing period, a drought surcharge for water delivered in excess of the basic allotment. The surcharge is as follows:</text>
