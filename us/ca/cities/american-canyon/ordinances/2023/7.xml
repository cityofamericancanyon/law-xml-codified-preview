  <section>

    <text>Findings to Approve the Specific Plan Amendment in accordance with American Canyon Municipal Code Section 19.17.080</text>
    <para>
      <num>A.</num>
      <text>The distribution, location and extent of land uses, including open space, as depicted in the specific plan is consistent with the general plan.</text>
      <text>
        <em>The Watson Ranch Specific Plan sets forth the land uses, residential densities, non-residential intensities, permitted and conditional uses, development standards, and design guidelines for the WRSP Area and further implements the Policies set forth for the Town Center land use designation. The Watson Ranch Specific Plan is consistent with the General Plan. This Amendment has a corresponding amendment to the General Plan and is therefore consistent.</em>
      </text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>B.</num>
      <text>The specific plan provides for public infrastructure and services needed to support the land uses described in the plan, including adequate distribution, location, extent and intensity of transportation, sewage, water, drainage, solid waste disposal, energy, parks, community facilities and other essential facilities.</text>
      <text>
        <em>The Specific Plan does set forth the design for roadways, water, wastewater, recycled water, storm drainage systems, parks and other community facilities necessary to support the land uses described in the plan. Specifically, Chapters 4, 5, 7 and 8 of the WRSP address these facilities. This Amendment is consistent with the provision of these facilities.</em>
      </text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>C.</num>
      <text>The standards and development criteria, including requirements for resource utilization, will ensure that development proceeds in an orderly fashion and maintains a high level of quality.</text>
      <text>
        <em>Chapter 6 of the WRSP sets forth development standards which are supplemented by Design Guidelines in Appendix A. The development standards and design guidelines together promote efficient resource utilization, best practices, and sustainability to ensure a high level of quality. Further Chapter 9, Implementation, sets forth the phasing program to ensure the development proceeds in an orderly fashion. This Amendment does not alter the standards and development criteria set forth in the Specific Plan and is therefore consistent.</em>
      </text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>D.</num>
      <text>The specific plan contains implementation measures, including financing programs, to ensure that development is supported by adequate infrastructure as it occurs.</text>
      <text>
        <em>WRSP Chapter 9, Implementation, sets forth the financing principles and policies, identifies different financing mechanisms, and sets forth phasing of supporting infrastructure. This Amendment supports the provisions of the Development Agreement which, consistent with the Specific plan, provides further clarity on financing and phasing of infrastructure. Therefore, this Amendment does not materially alter the implementation plan set forth in the Specific Plan and is therefore consistent.</em>
      </text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>E.</num>
      <text>The site is suitable for the type and intensity of development proposed.</text>
      <text>
        <em>As determined through the initial existing conditions analysis and the preparation of the WRSP Final EIR, the WRSP site is suitable for the type and intensity of the proposed development associated with this Amendment. The Amendment does not alter the type and intensity of development proposal and is therefore consistent.</em>
      </text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>F.</num>
      <text>The flexibility in development standards afforded by the specific plan process has resulted in a project providing more superior design and amenities than would occur under more traditional zoning practices, and the project provides clear and substantial benefit to the city.</text>
      <text>
        <em>The WRSP Project implements the General Plan for the Town Center land use designation, consistent with Objective 1.19 of the General Plan: "Provide for the development of a Town Center that physically and functionally serves as the symbolic and identifiable focus of community activities and events for the City of American Canyon and which is a regional destination within Napa Valley." General Plan Policy 1.19.7 designated that the land uses in this area be developed pursuant to one or more specific plans. The WRSP includes Development Standards and Design Guidelines that promote diverse neighborhood design and integrated housing types. It further provides for the creation of a "Town Center" through the renovation of the cement factory ruins while preserving the unique character of this site feature. This Amendment does not alter the flexibility in development standards, the superior design or amenities of the Specific Plan and is therefore consistent.</em>
