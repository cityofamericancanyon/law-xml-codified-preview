        <heading>Findings and determination.</heading>
        <text>As permitted in Health and Safety Code Section 17958.7, the city of American Canyon finds and determines the local amendments to the 2022 California Building Code are either administrative in nature or reasonably necessary to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the public due to local climatic, geological or topographical conditions. Those findings are as follows:</text>
        <text>Express Finding Number 1: Climatic. The city is located in a climatic zone with precipitation ranging from fifteen to twenty-six inches per year. Ninety-five percent of precipitation falls during the months of November through April, leaving a dry period of approximately six months each year. Relative humidity remains moderate most of the time. High temperatures in the summer average in the mid-eighty degrees Fahrenheit and in the winter in the mid-fifty degrees Fahrenheit. Prevailing winds in the area are common with gusts up to thirty-five miles per hour. These climatic conditions, along with our topography, necessitate a greater requirement for fire-sprinklers in residential construction, a minimum Class A roof covering and adequate spark arrestors.</text>
        <text>Express Finding Number 2: Geological. The city is located in Seismic Design Category D, which is indicative of high seismic vulnerability. The West Napa fault is documented to be present in our city. The area includes various soil conditions and areas with significant movement potential. Buildings and other structures in Seismic Design Category D can experience major seismic damage. These geological conditions necessitate the prohibition of gypsum as a lateral-resisting building element, and the restriction of Portland cement plaster as a lateral-resisting building element to one-story structures of R-3 and U-1 occupancies.</text>
        <text>Express Finding Number 3: Topographical. Areas of highly combustible dry grasses, weeds, brush and trees adjacent to structures are common throughout the city. Above-ground electrical power transmission lines are suspended through trees and above large areas of dry vegetation. The arrangement of man-made features around many buildings greatly limits any approach to all but one side of a building. The area immediately adjacent to the eastern border of the city has been classified as high and very high fire severity zones under the Fire and Resource Assessment Program of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. These topographical conditions, along with our climate, necessitate a greater requirement for fire-sprinklers in residential construction, a minimum Class A roof covering and adequate spark arrestors.

        <text>Section 105.5 is hereby deleted and amended to read as follows:</text>
        <text>Every permit issued by the Building Official under the provisions of this code shall expire by limitation and become null and void if the building, structure, equipment or work authorized by such permit is not commenced within twelve (12) months from the date of such permit, or if the building, structure, equipment or work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned at any time after the work is commenced for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days.</text>
        <text>Before such work can recommence, a new permit shall be first obtained to do so, and the recommence fee shall be one half the amount required for a new permit (i.e. building, electrical, plumbing and mechanical fees only) for such work, provided no changes have been made or will be made in the original plans and specifications for such work, and provided further such suspension or abandonment has not exceeded one year. To renew a permit after expiration for over one year, the permittee shall pay new full permit fee. The maximum life of any permit is three (3) years.</text>
        <text>Any permittee holding an unexpired permit may apply for an extension of the time within which work may commence under that permit when the permittee is unable to commence work within the time frame required by this section for good and satisfactory reasons. The Building Official may extend the time for action by the permittee for a period not exceeding one hundred eighty (180) days on written request by the permittee showing circumstances beyond the control of the permittee that prevented action from being taken.</text>

        <text><strong>3403.6.2.2.2 Extent of Repair for Compliant Buildings.</strong> If the evaluation establishes compliance of the pre-damage building in accordance with Section 3403.6.2.2.1, then repairs shall be permitted that restore the building to its pre-damage state, using materials and strengths that existed prior to the damage.</text>
        <text><strong>3403.6.2.2.3 Extent of Repair for Non-Compliant Buildings. </strong>If the evaluation does not establish compliance of the pre-damage building in accordance with Section 3403.6.2.2.1, then the building shall be rehabilitated to comply with applicable provisions of the building code for load combinations including wind or seismic forces. The wind design level for the repair shall be as required by the building code in effect at the time of original construction unless the damage was caused by wind, in which case the design level shall be as required by the code in effect at the time of original construction or as required by the building code, whichever is greater. Seismic forces for this rehabilitation design shall be those required for the design of the predamaged building, but not less than the reduced level seismic forces specified in Section 3403.6.1.1.3. New structural members and connections required by this rehabilitation design shall comply with the detailing provisions of the building code for new buildings of similar structure, purpose, and location.</text>
        <text><strong>3403.6.2.3 Substantial Structural Damage to Vertical Load-Carrying Components.</strong> Vertical load-carrying components that have sustained substantial structural damage shall be rehabilitated to comply with the applicable provisions for dead and live loads in the building code. Undamaged vertical load-carrying components that receive dead or live loads from rehabilitated components shall also be rehabilitated to carry the design loads of the rehabilitation design. New structural members and connections required by this rehabilitation design shall comply with the detailing provisions of the building code for new buildings of similar structure, purpose, and location.</text>
        <text><strong>3403.6.2.3.1 Lateral Force-Resisting Elements.</strong> Regardless of the level of damage to vertical elements of the lateral force-resisting system, if substantial structural damage to vertical load-carrying components was caused primarily by wind or seismic effects, then the building shall be evaluated in accordance with Section 3403.6.2.2.1 and, if non-compliant, rehabilitated in accordance with Section 3403.6.2.2.3.</text>
        <text><strong>3403.6.2.4 Less than Substantial Structural Damage.</strong> For damage less than substantial structural damage, repairs shall be allowed that restore the building to its pre-damage state, using materials and strengths that existed prior to the damage. New structural members and connections used for this repair shall comply with the detailing provisions of the building code for new buildings of similar structure, purpose, and location.</text>

        <heading>Intent and purpose.</heading>
        <text>The intent and purpose of this chapter is to adopt an expedited, streamlined solar permitting process that complies with the Solar Rights Act and AB 2188 (Chapter 521, Statutes 2014) to achieve timely and cost-effective installations of small residential rooftop solar energy systems. This chapter is designed to encourage the use of solar systems by removing unreasonable barriers, minimizing costs to property owners and the city, and expanding the ability of property owners to install solar energy systems. This chapter allows the city to achieve these goals while protecting the public health and safety. (Ord. 2015-09 § 1, 2015)</text>

      <heading>Findings and determination.</heading>
      <text>As permitted in Health and Safety Code Section 17958.7, the city of American Canyon finds and determines the local amendments to the 2022 California Building Code are either administrative in nature or reasonably necessary to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the public due to local climatic, geological or topographical conditions. Those findings are as follows:</text>
      <text>Express Finding Number 1: Climatic. The city is located in a climatic zone with precipitation ranging from fifteen to twenty-six inches per year. Ninety-five percent of precipitation falls during the months of November through April, leaving a dry period of approximately six months each year. Relative humidity remains moderate most of the time. High temperatures in the summer average in the mid-eighty degrees Fahrenheit and in the winter in the mid-fifty degrees Fahrenheit. Prevailing winds in the area are common with gusts up to thirty-five miles per hour. These climatic conditions, along with our topography, necessitate a greater requirement for fire-sprinklers in residential construction, a minimum Class A roof covering and adequate spark arrestors.</text>
      <text>Express Finding Number 2: Geological. The city is located in Seismic Design Category D, which is indicative of high seismic vulnerability. The West Napa fault is documented to be present in our city. The area includes various soil conditions and areas with significant movement potential. Buildings and other structures in Seismic Design Category D can experience major seismic damage. These geological conditions necessitate the prohibition of gypsum as a lateral-resisting building element, and the restriction of Portland cement plaster as a lateral-resisting building element to one-story structures of R-3 and U-1 occupancies.</text>
      <text>Express Finding Number 3: Topographical. Areas of highly combustible dry grasses, weeds, brush and trees adjacent to structures are common throughout the city. Above-ground electrical power transmission lines are suspended through trees and above large areas of dry vegetation. The arrangement of man-made features around many buildings greatly limits any approach to all but one side of a building. The area immediately adjacent to the eastern border of the city has been classified as high and very high fire severity zones under the Fire and Resource Assessment Program of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. These topographical conditions, along with our climate, necessitate a greater requirement for fire-sprinklers in residential construction, a minimum Class A roof covering and adequate spark arrestors.
