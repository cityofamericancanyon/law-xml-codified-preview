      <heading>Findings and declarations.</heading>
      <text>In addition to and in accordance with the determination made and the authority granted by the state of California under Section 22660 of the State <cite doc="Cal. Veh. Code">Vehicle Code</cite> to remove abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles, or parts thereof, as public nuisances, the council makes the following findings and declarations:</text>
      <text>The accumulation and storage of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles or parts thereof on private or public property, is found to create a condition tending to reduce the value of private property, to promote blight and deterioration, to invite plundering, to create fire hazards, to constitute an attractive nuisance creating a hazard to the health and safety of minors, to create harborage for rodents and insects, and to be injurious to the health, safety and general welfare. Therefore the presence of an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicle or parts thereof, on private or public property, except as expressly hereinafter permitted, is declared to constitute a public nuisance which may be abated as such in accordance with the provisions of <cite path="10.36">this chapter</cite>.</text>
      <text>The council also finds and declares that constructive leisure pursuits by residents of the city of American Canyon is most important. <cite path="10.36">This chapter</cite> is intended to encourage responsible participation in the hobby of collecting, preserving, restoring, and maintaining motor vehicles of historic and special interest, which contributes to the enjoyment of citizens and the preservation of California memorabilia.</text>
      <text><cite path="10.36">This chapter</cite> is the specific standard to control and regulate abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles, notwithstanding the provisions of <cite path="9.04">Chapter 9.04</cite> of <cite path="10">this title</cite>.</text>
