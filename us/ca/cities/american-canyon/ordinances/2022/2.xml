  </recitals>
  <section>
    <num>1</num>
    <text>FINDINGS.  Based on the following evidence and as required by Zoning Ordinance Section 19.48.040 C, the City Council finds that:</text>
    <para>
      <num>a.</num>
      <text>The amendment is consistent with the goals and policies of the general plan.</text>
      <text><em>General Plan Opportunities and Constraints #15 states that</em> c<em>limate change impacts pose an immediate and growing threat to California's economy, environment, and public health. The effects of climate change in American Canyon include increased temperatures, decreased air quality, reduced precipitation, flooding, a prolonged wildfire seasons and firestorms, mudslides, severe droughts, reduced water supply, property destruction, and damage to infrastructure.</em></text>
      <text>
        <em>To address these constraints, the proposed ordinance will fulfill related General Plan Policy 1.37.2 which states: "Recognizing that the transportation sector is the largest source of GHG emissions in American Canyon and in California more broadly, prohibit construction of new fossil-fuel stations in American Canyon."   The proposed Ordinance would achieve Policy 1.37.2 by prohibiting new fossil fuel stations in American Canyon.  The proposed ordinance includes reasonable measures to address nonconforming gas stations and unforeseen "Force Majeure" events that cause a gap in gas station operations.</em>
      </text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>b.</num>
      <text>The amendment is consistent with the purposes of this title, as set forth in Chapter 19.01, Authority, Purposes and Effects of the Zoning Ordinance.</text>
      <text>
        <em>The amendment is consistent with the purpose of the Zoning Ordinance to protect and promote the public health, safety, peace, comfort, convenience, aesthetics, prosperity, and general welfare consistent with the City Council Climate Change Emergency Proclamation that acknowledges climate change caused by human activity represents a growing danger to human health, safety, and economic prosperity, and commits to a goal of net zero climate pollution, measured in terms of net contribution to excess trapped heat, by or before 2030 by implementing immediate and sustained actions in support of its achievement.</em>
