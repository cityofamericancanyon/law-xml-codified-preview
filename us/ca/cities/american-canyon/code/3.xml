      <heading>Definitions.</heading>
      <text>Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in <cite path="|3.24.020">this section</cite> shall govern the construction of <cite path="3.24">this chapter</cite>:</text>
      <text>"Hotel" means any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or intended or designed for use or occupancy by transients, including but not limited to dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodginghouse, roominghouse, apartment house, timeshare project or facility, dormitory, public or private club, mobile home or house trailer at a fixed location, or other similar structure or portion thereof, duplex, triplex, single-family dwelling units except any private dwelling house or other individually owned single-family dwelling house unit rented only occasionally (infrequently) and incidentally to the normal occupancy by the owner or his family; provided that the burden of establishing that the housing or facility is a hotel as defined herein shall be upon the owner or operator thereof who shall file with the tax administrator such information as the tax administrator may require, to establish and maintain such status.</text>
      <text>"Occupancy" means the use or possession, or the right or entitlement to the use or possession, of any hotel, room, rooms or any portion thereof offered for rent to be used or occupied for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes regardless of the purpose for which such rooms are rented or provided.</text>
      <text>"Operator" means the person who is proprietor of the hotel whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sub-lessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, timeshare project or facility manager or operator, or in any other capacity. Where the operator performs his or its functions through a managing agent of any type or character, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purpose of <cite path="3.24">this chapter</cite>, and shall have jointly and severally the same duties and liabilities as the principal. Compliance with the provisions of <cite path="3.24">this chapter</cite> by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be in compliance by both.</text>
      <text>"Person" means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate, or any other group or combination acting as a unit.</text>
      <text>"Rent" means the amount of the consideration charged or chargeable to the tenant or person entitled to occupancy, for the occupancy of space, valued in money whether received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including the full value of receipts, cash, credits, property or services of any kind or nature, without any deduction whatsoever. "Rent" may have been, or may be in part, payable or paid prior to or following (in whole or in part) the occupancy to which it is attributable, and may have been paid in whole or in part in advance on a long-term basis, such as in a time-share project or similar arrangement. It is not the intent of this subsection to make the operator liable for the tax on uncollected rent. However, uncollected rent must be reported.</text>
      <text>"Tax administrator" means the city manager or his designated agent, whether a city employee or county officer or employee.</text>
      <text>"Time-share occupancy" means occupancy related to the situation wherein a purchaser receives the right or entitlement in perpetuity, for life, or for a term of years or other extended term, to the recurrent, exclusive use or occupancy of a lot, parcel, unit, room(s), hotel or portion thereof, or segment of real property, annually or on some other seasonal or periodic basis, for a period of time that has been or will be allotted from the use or occupancy periods into which the time-share project which is involved has been divided. The said right or entitlement to occupancy may attach in advance to a specific lot, parcel, unit, room(s), or portion of a hotel, or segment of real property, or may involve designation or selection of the same at a future time or times.</text>
      <text>"Transient" means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license, timeshare arrangement or ownership or agreement, or other agreement of whatever nature, for a period of thirty consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient if his actual total period of occupancy does not exceed thirty days. Unless day of occupancy or entitlement to occupancy by one person are consecutive without any break, then prior or subsequent periods of such occupancy or entitlement to occupancy shall not be counted when determining whether a period exceeds the stated thirty calendar days.</text>
