        <text>This Article is applicable to all warehousing, logistics and distribution facilities throughout the city for which a Notice of Preparation is issued after March 1, 2024 under the implementing Guidelines of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).</text>
        <text>A warehousing, logistics or distribution facility means facilities used for the storage and/or consolidation of manufactured goods (and to a lesser extent, raw materials and excludes bulk storage of materials, which are flammable or explosive or create hazardous or commonly recognized offensive conditions) before their distribution to retail locations or other warehouses. The facilities are generally greater than 200,000 square feet in size, with a land coverage ratio of approximately 50 to 80 percent, and a dock-high loading door ratio of approximately 1:5,000-8,000 square feet. They are characterized by dock high loading doors, could be on opposing sides of the building (cross dock facility); significant movement and storage of products, materials, or equipment; truck activities frequently outside of the peak hour of the adjacent street system; and freeway access, including:</text>
        <text>
          <ul>
            <li>Freight yards/forwarding terminals</li>
            <li>Warehousing distribution/high cube distribution centers</li>

        <text><cite path="19.11">This chapter</cite> establishes two zoning districts to allow a broad range of commercial uses within those districts. The following commercial districts are hereby established:</text>
        <text>CC (community commercial) district: to accommodate a broad range of commercial uses that will serve local residents and the greater community and reduce the need for external trips to adjacent jurisdictions for goods and services, and provide shopping and service opportunities for commuters, visitors, and tourists. Also accommodates multifamily residential uses, especially in conjunction with a commercial use.</text>
        <text>CN (neighborhood commercial) district: to encourage a limited range of retail and service commercial uses that are oriented to the day-to-day needs of the local residents, at a scale compatible with adjacent neighborhoods. Also accommodates multifamily residential uses, especially in conjunction with a commercial use.</text>

        <heading>Definition.</heading>
        <text>As used in <cite path="19.29">this chapter</cite>, a "home occupation" is an accessory use of a dwelling for employment and/or business purposes that is incidental to and subordinate to the use of the dwelling unit as a residence, and that is so located and conducted that the average neighbor, under normal circumstances, would not be aware of its existence. Large family child care homes are exempt from this definition.</text>

        <text>The purpose of <cite path="19.34">this chapter</cite> is to establish necessary and appropriate policies related to conversion of senior housing projects to non-senior housing projects.</text>

        <heading>Findings.</heading>
        <para>
          <num>(A)</num>
          <text>California's Unruh Civil Rights Act (<cite doc="Cal. Civ. Code" path="§51.1">Civil Code Section 51.1</cite> et seq.) expressly allows private parties to establish housing for senior citizens and the Federal Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. Section 3601 et seq.) expressly allows for "housing for older persons."</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <num>(B)</num>
          <text>State law encourages "senior citizen housing developments." Specifically, <cite doc="Cal. Gov't Code" path="§65915">Government Code Section 65915</cite> requires cities to provide "senior citizen housing developments" density bonuses for development of such facilities and provide lower parking standards. Therefore, by law, "senior only" housing facilities may receive concessions and incentives that non-senior facilities do not receive.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <num>(C)</num>
          <text>On average, senior citizens make less impact on the environment than do non-seniors. Occupancy rates for seniors are significantly less than non-senior occupancy rates. Seniors make substantially fewer trips than non-seniors. Seniors drive fewer vehicles, and therefore require fewer parking spaces per housing unit than do non-seniors. <cite path="19.34">This chapter</cite> acknowledges these facts when it applies a lower parking requirement for certain senior housing facilities than would have otherwise applied.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <num>(D)</num>
          <text>Because, on average, senior citizens occupy few persons per dwelling unit than non-senior citizen residents, seniors use substantially less water per household than non-seniors. Therefore, if there is no discretionary process to administer changes from senior to non-senior mobilehome parks, the city's zero water footprint policy will not be applied to such land use changes. This will further jeopardize the city's ability to supply water to its residents in accordance with the fee structure adopted by the city council.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <num>(E)</num>
          <text>Based on the foregoing, newly created or authorized non-senior facilities have a greater impact on the environment than do existing senior facilities. Therefore, the city determines that all conversions, as defined in <cite path="19.34">this chapter</cite>, are "projects" within the meaning of <cite doc="Cal. Pub. Res. Code" path="§21065">Public Resources Code Section 21065</cite>.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <num>(F)</num>
          <text><cite doc="Cal. Gov't Code" path="§65595">Government Code Section 65595</cite> et seq., permit all of the following developments to pay lower developer fees to schools: developments which qualify as "senior citizen housing," "multilevel facility for the elderly" or as a "residential care facility for the elderly," and manufactured homes and mobilehomes in certain communities limited to older persons.</text>
        </para>
        <para>

          <text><cite doc="Cal. Gov't Code">Government Code</cite> Sections <cite doc="Cal. Gov't Code" path="§65595.1">65595.1</cite> and <cite doc="Cal. Gov't Code" path="§65595.2">65595.2</cite> demonstrate that cities should often disallow these senior housing uses from converting to</text>

        <text>For the purposes of <cite path="19.49">this chapter</cite>, the following terms are defined as follows:</text>
        <text>"Appraised valuation" means either the appraised valuation for property tax purposes, updated as necessary by the increase in the consumer price index since the date of the last valuation, or the valuation determined by a professionally-recognized property appraiser.</text>
        <text>"Cost" of renovation or repair or replacement means the fair market value of the materials and services necessary to accomplish such renovation, repair, or replacement. Renovation, repair, or replacement costs shall be determined by the building official, whose decision may be appealed to the city council. The "cost" of such renovation of repair or replacement shall mean the total cost of all such intended work, and no person may seek to avoid the intent of <cite path="19.49">this chapter</cite> by doing such work incrementally.</text>
        <text>"Nonconforming lots" means a lot, the area dimensions, or location of which was lawful prior to the effective date of <cite path="19">this title</cite>, or any amendment thereto, but which fails by reason of such adoption, revision, or amendment to conform to the present requirements of the zoning district in which it is located.</text>
        <text>"Nonconforming structure" means any structure that was lawfully established and in compliance with the applicable ordinances and laws at the time the ordinance codified in <cite path="19">this title</cite> or any amendment thereto became effective, but which, due to the application of <cite path="19">this title</cite> or any amendment thereto, no longer complies with all the applicable regulations and standards of development in the zoning district in which it is located.</text>
        <text>"Nonconforming use" means any use of land or property that was lawfully established and in compliance with all applicable ordinances and laws at the time the ordinance codified in <cite path="19">this title</cite>, or any amendment thereto, became effective, but which, due to the application of <cite path="19">this title</cite> or any amendment thereto is a use not listed as permitted, accessory, or subject to permit in the zoning district in which it is located. "Nonconforming use" shall also include uses reclassified from permitted to subject to permit in the same district, and uses made nonconforming by the addition of a development standard previously not required for such use in the same zoning classification, where such added standard is specified to be a "condition of use."</text>

        <text><cite path="19.54">This chapter</cite> establishes a new City development entitlement known as the Sustainable, Energy-Efficient Warehouse Design Permit, which is ministerial and thus is not subject to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). <cite path="19.54">This chapter</cite> establishes a non-discretionary review and permitting process designed to encourage landowners to seek the development of eligible projects, which will by necessity include design features and conditions of approval intended to facilitate sustainability and minimize the projects' environmental effects. <cite path="19.54">This chapter</cite> applies to warehouse projects located in the GI (general industrial) district meeting the requirements of <cite path="19.54">this chapter</cite>. Any requirements found outside <cite path="19.54">this chapter (19.54)</cite> for projects in the GI district that are inconsistent with the requirements and streamlining provisions of <cite path="19.54">this chapter (19.54)</cite> shall not apply to sustainable, energy-efficient warehouse projects that satisfy the requirements of <cite path="19.54">this chapter (19.54)</cite> and therefore qualify for the benefits of its streamlined review and permitting process.</text>

The Tribe shall have the final determination as to the disposition and treatment of human remains and grave goods. Said determination may include avoidance of the human remains, reburial on-site, or reburial on tribal or other lands that will not be disturbed in the future. The Tribe may wish to rebury said human remains and grave goods or ceremonial and cultural items on or near the site of their discovery, in an area which will not be subject to future disturbances over a prolonged period of time. Reburial of human remains shall be accomplished in compliance with the <cite doc="Cal. Pub. Res. Code">California Public Resources Code</cite> Sections 5097.98(a) and (b).
